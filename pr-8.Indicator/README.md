This repository contains C programming assignments based on the concept of **pointers**.  
The objective of these programs is to understand how pointers work with **strings** and **2D arrays** in C programming.

### Q1. Length Finder
The objective of this program is to find the **length of a given string using a pointer**.  
Instead of using built-in functions, the program traverses the string character by character until the null character is found.

**Input**
- A string entered by the user

**Output**
- Length of the entered string

**Key Concept Used**
- Pointer to character
- String traversal using pointer

### Q2. Cubes Generator
The objective of this program is to calculate the **cube of each element of a 2D array** using **pointers and a User Defined Function (UDF)**.

The array elements are accessed using pointer arithmetic, and the cube of each element is displayed in matrix format.

**Input**
- Size of the 2D array
- Elements of the array

**Output**
- Cube of each array element
